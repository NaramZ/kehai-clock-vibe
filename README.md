Abstract / Digital Clock

This project features a unique web-based clock with two distinct display modes: an abstract, artistic representation and a modern digital display, all within a beautifully styled circular interface. It's built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, demonstrating dynamic UI updates without the need for complex frameworks.
Features

    Abstract Clock Mode:

        Displays time using two blurred, abstract hands (hour and minute) and a rotating red dot for seconds.

        Features a frosted glass effect, subtle reflections, and light rays for a sophisticated visual.

        Hands and dot move smoothly, originating from the center bottom of the clock.

    Digital Clock Mode:

        Presents time in a clear, blurred digital format, styled to resemble a "flip clock" aesthetic.

        Accurately displays hours and minutes.

    Interactive Controls:

        Manual Time Setting: Adjust the hour and minute manually using sliders.

        Time Zone Selection: Choose from an extensive list of global time zones to display accurate local time.

        Customization Options:

            Change the red dot's color.

            Adjust the overall blur level of the frosted glass.

            Control the graininess of the frosted glass.

            Modify the blur level of the red dot.

        Toggle Display Mode: Seamlessly switch between Abstract and Digital clock modes.
